FlatPack Furniture Assumptions:

Boards:
-Main Coordinates come in counter-clockwise order
	-Plug connecting lines will originally be included on main shape (Redundancy)
-Hole comes in clockwise order
-Joint connecting lines must also be given in CCW orientation
-Joint connecting Lines will always be same distance 

Imported JSON data for Joints includes:
-plug name, plug connecting line
-Receptor name, plug connecting line
-joint type


For now all joints are in 2D

Joints:
-Right now individual joints can be hidden. This might be changed to all or nothing
-Edge Joints must have same distance connecting line and be on edge of main shape
