FlatPack Furniture Assumptions:

Boards:
-Main Coordinates come in counter-clockwise order
	-Plug connecting lines will originally be included on main shape (Redundancy)
-Hole comes in clockwise order
-Joint connecting lines must also be given in CCW orientation

Imported JSON data for Joints includes:
-plug name, plug connecting line
-Receptor name, plug connecting line
-joint type


For now all joints are in 2D
